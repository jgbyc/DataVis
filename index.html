      <h1>Unemployment Rates Vary Significantly Across Different Worker Group</h1>
      <p>
        The unemployment rate is widely used to assess the state of the economy because it varies strongly with the business cycle, 
        rising when the economy is in a recession and gradually decreasing during economic booms.
        However, economic fluctuations affect unemployment for various groups differently depending on gender, race and education level.
        <br></br>
        By presenting the unemployment rates of different worker groups of <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Education Level</span>
        (<span style = "color: #0FB5AE; font-weight: bold;">Primary School</span>, <span style = "color: #4046CA; font-weight: bold;">High School</span>, <span style = "color: #F68511; font-weight: bold;">Associates Degree</span>, <span style = "color: #DE3D82; font-weight: bold;">Professional Degree</span>), 
        <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Race</span> (<span style = "color: #72E06A; font-weight: bold;">White</span>, <span style = "color: #147AF3; font-weight: bold;">Black</span>, <span style = "color: #7326D3; font-weight: bold;">Asian</span>, <span style = "color: #E8C600; font-weight: bold;">Hispanic</span>) 
        and <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Gender</span> (<span style = "color: #CB5D00; font-weight: bold;">Male</span>, <span style = "color: #008F5D; font-weight: bold;">Female</span>), 
        this data visualization work is trying to present and deliver the
        information that certain worker groups suffer highest unemployment rates. Also, they are the most sensitive to periods of economic growth and decline.
