      <h1>Unemployment Rates Vary Significantly Across Different Worker Group</h1>
      <p>
        The unemployment rate is widely used to assess the state of the economy because it varies strongly with the business cycle, 
        rising when the economy is in a recession and gradually decreasing during economic booms.
        However, economic fluctuations affect unemployment for various groups differently depending on gender, race and education.

        <br></br>
        By presenting the unemployment rates of different worker groups of <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Education Level</span>
        (<span class = "primarySchool">Primary School</span>, <span class = "highSchool">High School</span>, <span class = "associatesDegree">Associates Degree</span>, <span class = "professionalDegree">Professional Degree</span>), 
        <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Race</span> (<span class = "White">White</span>, <span class = "Black">Black</span>, <span class = "Asian">Asian</span>, <span class = "Hispanic">Hispanic</span>) 
        and <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Gender</span> (<span class = "Male">Male</span>, <span class = "Female">Female</span>), 
        this data visualization work is trying to present and deliver the
        information that certain worker groups suffer highest unemployment rates. Also, they are the most sensitive to periods of economic growth and decline.

        This scene presents the rates of different education levels from Jan 2010 to Mar 2020. The chart suggests that workers with only <span class = "primarySchool">Primary School</span>
        education suffers highest unemployment rates and are most sensitive to economic change caused by major event (<span class = "majorEvent">Economy Recession</span> and <span class = "majorEvent">Covid Pandemic</span>). You can also drag the <span style="font-weight:bold">Slider Bar</span> on the bottom preview section to view the curve details
        at <span style="font-weight:bold">any time range</span>.
